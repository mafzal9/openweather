# Welcome to OpenWeather

<p>OpenWeather is an open source project related to Environment Monitoring.
Environment Monitoring is very important aspect for our surrounding but on the other hand it also cost alot which is very diffcult for under developed countries to deploy such type of system.
So at OpenWeather we have aim to Setup a cloud and an affordable Open Source Hardware kit for volunteers to setup their own Environment Monitoring Station.</p>
